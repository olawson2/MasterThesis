\section{The Average Model of Power Electronic Converters}

Power electronic converters are operated by switching transistors at frequencies in kHz. This switching causes harmonics, which can cause complications in modelling and simulating the converters' behaviour. Average models can thus be used to simplify the description and simulation of the converters \cite{Jankovic_Averaged_Model}.
